abstract: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has become a global concern for its severe adverse effects on both mother and fetus. Recent epidemiological studies reported inconsistent results of the association between cadmium (Cd) exposure and GDM. Therefore, a systematic review and meta- analysis were performed. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and SpringerLink were searched up to July 2021. Observational studies containing the adjusted relative risks between Cd exposure and GDM were included in the quantitative synthesis. The retrieval comprised 218 articles out of which 11 met our criteria and 9 were included in the meta-analysis, representing a total of 32,392 subjects (2881 GDM). In total, Cd exposure might increase the risk of GDM in some extent (OR = 1.21, 95% CI [0.89, 1.64]), even without statistical significance in high heterogeneity (Q = 28.45, p < 0.05, I2 = 71.9%). Filtering two outliers indicated by Galbraith plot yielded a similar risk (OR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.02, 1.39]) with statistical significance. However, the heterogeneity among studies was obviously reduced (Q = 11.75, p = 0.068, I2 = 48.9%). Additionally, biological specimen, study design, and diagnostic criteria contributed to the high heterogeneity according to the subgroup analysis. Since some important results do not deny that Cd exposure increases the risk of GDM, high-quality multi-centered large cohort studies are required in the future.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Our meta-analysis proposes another important sight to investigate the etiology of metabolic gestational disease in terms of the alterations after heavy metal exposure.
