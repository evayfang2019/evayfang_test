	abstract = {Mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) is a metabolite of DEHP which is one of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) widely used in daily necessities. Moreover, MEHP has been proven to have stronger biological toxicity comparing to DEHP. In particular, several recent population-based studies have reported that intrauterine exposure to MEHP results in adverse pregnancy outcomes. To explore the mechanisms and metabolic biomarkers of MEHP exposure, we examined the metabolic status of HTR-8/Svneo cell lines exposed to different doses of MEHP (0, 1.25, 5.0, 20 μM). Global and dose-response metabolomics tools were used to identify metabolic perturbations and sensitive markers associated with MEHP. Only 22 metabolic features (accounted for {\textless}1 \%) were significantly changed when exposed to 1.25 μM. However, when the exposure dose was increased to 5 or 20 μM, the number of significantly changed metabolic features exceeded 300 (approximately 10 \%). In particular, amino acid metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism and glutathione metabolism were widely affected according to the enrich analysis of those significant altered metabolites, which has and have previously been reported to be closely related to fetal development. Moreover, 5'-UMP and N-acetylputrescine with the lowest effective concentrations (EC-10 = 0.1 μM and EC+10 = 0.11 μM, respectively) were identified as sensitive endogenous biomarkers of MEHP exposure.},
