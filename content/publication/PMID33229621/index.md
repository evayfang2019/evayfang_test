abstract: This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed at determining whether paternal age is a risk factor for offspring birth defects.A total of 38 and 11 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Compared with reference, fathers aged 25 to 29, young fathers (< 20 years) could increase the risk of urogenital abnormalities (OR 1.50, 95 % CI 1.03–2.19) and chromosome disorders (OR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.12–1.52) in their offsprings; old fathers (≥ 40 years) could increase the risk of cardiovascular abnormalities (OR 1.10, 95 % CI 1.01–1.20), facial deformities (OR 1.08, 95 % CI 1.00–1.17), urogenital abnormalities (OR 1.28, 95 % CI 1.07–1.52), and chromosome disorders (OR 1.30, 95 % CI 1.12–1.52).Our study indicated that paternal age is associated with a moderate increase in the incidence of urogenital and cardiovascular abnormalities, facial deformities, and chromosome disorders.
