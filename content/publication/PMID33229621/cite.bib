	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed at determining whether paternal age is a risk factor for offspring birth defects.
RESULTS: A total of 38 and 11 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Compared with reference, fathers aged 25 to 29, young fathers ({\textless} 20 years) could increase the risk of urogenital abnormalities (OR: 1.50, 95 \% CI: 1.03-2.19) and chromosome disorders (OR: 1.38, 95 \% CI: 1.12-1.52) in their offsprings; old fathers (â‰¥ 40 years) could increase the risk of cardiovascular abnormalities (OR: 1.10, 95 \% CI: 1.01-1.20), facial deformities (OR: 1.08, 95 \% CI: 1.00-1.17), urogenital abnormalities (OR: 1.28, 95 \% CI: 1.07-1.52), and chromosome disorders (OR: 1.30, 95 \% CI: 1.12-1.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that paternal age is associated with a moderate increase in the incidence of urogenital and cardiovascular abnormalities, facial deformities, and chromosome disorders.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched for relevant literatures from 1960 to February 2020. The systematic review follows PRISMA guidelines. Relevant meta-analyses were performed.},
