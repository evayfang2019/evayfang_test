abstract: To explore the relationship between phthalate esters£¨PAEs£©and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons£¨PAHs£© exposure and clinical preterm birth during early pregnancy. A total of 821 pregnant women, receiving their prenatal examination in Hubei Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, were selected. Baseline questionnaire survey, morning urine collection and follow-up to pregnancy outcome were conducted. A total of ten PAE and ten PAH metabolites were quantitatively analyzed in urine samples. The Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, and the logistic regression models were used to analyze. The detection rate of five exposures in PAEs was more than 80%, and the detection rate of phthalic acid monobenzyl ester (MBzP) was less than 50%. The detection rate of 5 exposures in PAHs was more than 80%, and the detection rate of 3-hydroxyphene (3-OHPHE) was the highest (86.91%), while the detection rate of 4-hydroxyphene (4-OHPHE) was less than 50%. logistic regression analysis found that the risk of preterm delivery was higher in the MBzP group than in the corresponding low exposure group (aOR=2.26, 95%CI 1.17,4.39). This study found that high levels of MBzP exposure may be a risk factor for preterm birth.
