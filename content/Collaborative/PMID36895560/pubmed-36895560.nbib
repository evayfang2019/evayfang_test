AB  - Up to 50% of infertility is caused by the male side. Varicocele, orchitis, 
      prostatitis, oligospermia, asthenospermia, and azoospermia are common causes of 
      impaired male reproductive function and male infertility. In recent years, more 
      and more studies have shown that microorganisms play an increasingly important 
      role in the occurrence of these diseases. This review will discuss the 
      microbiological changes associated with male infertility from the perspective of 
      etiology, and how microorganisms affect the normal function of the male 
      reproductive system through immune mechanisms. Linking male infertility with 
      microbiome and immunomics can help us recognize the immune response under 
      different disease states, providing more targeted immune target therapy for these 
      diseases, and even the possibility of combined immunotherapy and microbial 
      therapy for male infertility.
