	abstract = {Male reproductive infections are known to shape the immunological homeostasis of the testes, leading to male infertility. However, the specific pathogenesis of these changes remains poorly understood. Exosomes released in the inflammatory microenvironment are important in communication between the local microenvironment and recipient cells. Here, we aim to identify the immunomodulatory properties of inflammatory testes-derived exosomes (IT-exos) and explore their underlying mechanisms in orchitis. IT-exos were isolated using a uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC)-induced orchitis model and confirmed that IT-exos promoted proinflammatory M1 activation with increasing expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in vitro. We further used small RNA sequencing to identify the differential miRNA profiles in exosomes and primary testicular macrophages (TMs) from normal and UPEC-infected testes, respectively, and identified that miR-155-5p was highly enriched in IT-exos and TMs from inflammatory testes. Further study of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) transfected with miR-155-5p mimic showed that macrophages polarized to proinflammatory phenotype. In addition, the mice that were administrated IT-exos showed remarkable activation of TM1-like macrophages; however, IT-exos with silencing miR-155-5p showed a decrease in proinflammatory responses. Overall, we demonstrate that miR-155-5p delivered by IT-exos plays an important role in the activation of TM1 in UPEC-induced orchitis. Our study provides a new perspective on the immunological mechanisms underlying inflammation-related male infertility.},
