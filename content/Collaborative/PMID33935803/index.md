abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been an ongoing pandemic and worldwide public health emergency, having drawn a lot of attention around the world. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is characterized by infecting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing cells, including testis-specific cells, namely, Leydig, Sertoli, and spermatogenic cells, which are closely related to male reproduction. This leads to aberrant hyperactivation of the immune system generating damage to the infected organs. An impairment in testicular function through uncontrolled immune responses alerts more attention to male infertility. Meanwhile, the recent clinical data indicate that the infection of the human testis with SARS-CoV-2 may impair male germ cell development, leading to germ cell loss and higher immune cell infiltration. In this review, we investigated the evidence of male reproductive dysfunction associated with the infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its possible immunological explanations and clinical remedies.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Some previous studies and recent bioinformatics analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 could infect ACE2-positive cells, including Leydig cells, SCs, and germ cells. Moreover, due to the characteristic immune function of the testis and potential immune-mediated damage caused by a cytokine storm, lymphopenia, and immunodepletion by COVID-19, male patients, especially with severe COVID-19, might exhibit impairments in fertility.
